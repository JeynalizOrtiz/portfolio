First assignment EVR628

Name: Jeynaliz Ortiz Gonzalez 

I am a second year Masters of Professional Science student in the Marine 
Conservation track. I am also an intern at the Shark Research and Conservation 
Lab, where I study shore-based subsistence fisheries in Miami-Dade County. 
Outside of academia, I'm a sea turtle biologist and the current lead for the 
artificial lighting team. My job requires handling disorientation data and 
reporting it to FWC. 

This Read Me file has been created as a requirement for the first assignment for
EVR628. 

The plot created in this project uses the Hurrican Milton data available in the
EVR628 package. I have created a scatter plot using measurements for latitude 
longitude (location of hurrican milton) and compared that to the speed at these 
varying locations.
