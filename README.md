First assignment EVR628

Name: Jeynaliz Ortiz Gonzalez 

I am a second year Masters of Professional Science student in the Marine 
Conservation track. I am also an intern at the Shark Research and Conservation 
Lab, where I study subsistence fisheries in Miami-Dade County. Outside of 
academia, I'm a sea turtle biologist and the current lead for the artificial 
lighting team. My job requires handling disorientation data and reporting it to
FWC. 

This Read Me file has been created as a requirement for the first assignment for
EVR628.
